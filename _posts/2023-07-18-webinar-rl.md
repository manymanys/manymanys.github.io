The ManyManys 1 project is thrilled to invite you to our upcoming open webinar, “Reversal Learning Across Taxa: Exploring Applications and Standardizing Procedures for Comparative Cognition Research,” which will take place on **September 1, 2023, at 10–12 AM (EST) / 9–11 AM (CST) / 7–9 AM (PST) / 3–5 PM (BST) / 4–6 PM (CEST)**. This event is an excellent opportunity to delve deeper into our network and discover opportunities for joining our team. We will explore various aspects of reversal learning, its applications, and its potential for shaping the future of comparative cognition research. We will also hold a discussion around the methodological details of the reversal learning task currently under development for ManyManys 1.

**Event schedule:**

〰️ 10:00–10:45 (EST). Presentation: “Reversal Learning Across Taxa: Exploring Applications and Standardizing Procedures for Comparative Cognition Research” by Dr. Nicolás Alessandroni (Concordia University, Canada).

〰️ 10:45–12:00 (EST). Open discussion: “Developing a Standardized Reversal Learning Task for ManyManys 1”, led by Dr. Laurent Prétôt (Pittsburg State University, USA).
