ManyManys is a Big Team Science network dedicated to investigating cognition and behavior across species. We are currently working towards finalizing the design of our first large-scale empirical study on reversal learning, and we want to ensure that all interested researchers have the opportunity to participate.
Our initial survey showed that many potential contributors are unfamiliar with the reversal learning paradigm. To address this, we are hosting a series of open webinars exploring how reversal learning can be implemented with different taxa. These sessions are open to both current MM members and researchers interested in joining this collaborative effort. If your lab collects behavioral data with any species, we encourage you to attend and learn how you can be part of this unprecedented comparative cognition study.
