We are excited to share that ManyManys has been selected as part of the inaugural cohort of the Open Scholarship Catalytic Awards Program by the [Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA)](https://www.orcaopen.org/)! This award will directly support ManyManys 1 (MM1)—our first cross-species study on reversal learning—and help expand the network’s training and capacity-building efforts.

Open science (OS) is a core part of what we do at ManyManys. From preprints and preregistration to open materials and data sharing, we are committed to embedding OS practices at every stage of the research process. Still, putting these practices into place in real-world workflows is not always straightforward—especially across diverse disciplines, institutions, and career stages. This award helps close that gap and make OS more practical and actionable across our network.

Between August and December 2025, we will run a training program tailored to researchers in comparative cognition and shaped by the needs and priorities of our community. We will host three live webinars on key OS topics led by experts—each one practical, interactive, and freely available. All materials and recordings will be published under open licenses to support broad reuse across the field.

The ORCA award also enables us to directly support students and early-career researchers. We will offer incentives to recognize meaningful OS contributions within MM1, and fund research assistants helping implement OS practices throughout the project. We have also welcomed a Community Officer who is helping coordinate meetings, support communication, and strengthen engagement across our growing network.

We are grateful to ORCA for making this work possible. You can learn more about the Open Scholarship Catalytic Awards Program [here](https://www.orcaopen.org/work/cap), and support ManyManys via our Open Collective profile [here](https://opencollective.com/manymanys).
