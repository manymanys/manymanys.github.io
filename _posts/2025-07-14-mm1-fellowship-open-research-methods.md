We are excited to launch the **ManyManys 1 Fellowship in Open Research Methods**â€”a funded opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to help shape [ManyManys 1](https://manymanys.github.io/MM1/), a large-scale collaboration investigating reversal learning skills across animal taxa. 

From August 15 to October 15, 2025, two fellows will take an active role in refining the study research design and directly contribute to producing the experimental protocol and lab manual that will be implemented across research groups and countries. Fellows will work closely with MM1 Leads and team members to embed open science practices throughout and support cross-lab coordination. If you are interested in animal cognition, open science practices, and Big Team Science collaborations, we encourage you to apply. Full details and instructions can be found [at this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18H0K8NLlLwO6QPnUhzKvSrMm0F9uKToTeFBchEWBaC0/edit?usp=sharing).

*This fellowship is supported by the [Open Scholarship Catalytic Award to ManyManys 1, granted by the Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA)](https://manymanys.github.io/2025-07-10-orca-award/).*
