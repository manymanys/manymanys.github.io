Nicolás Alessandroni, ManyManys 1 (MM1) project co-lead, recently spoke at the Diverse Intelligences Summit 2025! The Summit took place July 18-20 in St Andrews, Scotland, and brought together people from a wide variety of disciplines, including diverse developmental psychology, animal cognition, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Through his talk entitled *Scaling Up Comparative Cognition Through Big Team Science* (BTS), Nico discussed how projects like MM1 and its collaborative approach are breaking from the limitations of traditional research by building an international network of researchers working with large samples of several animal species.
