We are excited to launch registration for our first open webinar exploring the connection between open science and comparative cognition: Open Methods in Comparative Cognition Research.

This session will explore what it means to implement open methods in comparative cognition research. We will consider the challenges, practices, and caveats involved in applying open science principles to the field, with particular attention to developing species-fair designs and sustaining collaboration and transparency in the context of large-scale team science.

The webinar will feature presentations by Dr. Emma Tecwyn and Dr. Ben Farrar, followed by an interactive discussion with participants. It is free and open to all, whether or not you are part of the ManyManys network and regardless of career stage.

ðŸ“… When: September 12, 11:00 a.m. (ET) on Zoom

ðŸŽ¤ Presenters: Dr. Emma Tecwyn and Dr. Ben Farrar 

ðŸ”—Register here: [https://airtable.com/app0bcw8jYPvKXD0H/pagH2WslnaSWTt7GL/form](https://airtable.com/app0bcw8jYPvKXD0H/pagH2WslnaSWTt7GL/form) (Zoom details will be sent upon registration). 

**Emma** has a background spanning biological sciences, animal behaviour and psychology and is interested in the evolutionary and developmental origins of cognitive abilitiesâ€”particularly those implicated in problem-solving and decision-making. She uses behavioural experiments to investigate a range of cognitive abilities in diverse groups, with past projects having examined planning in great apes, intuitive statistics in capuchin monkeys, understanding of gravity and solidity in dogs, causal reasoning in toddlers and experience of time in children. Emma strives for open, transparent, and reproducible research practices in her work, but knows there is always more to learn!

**Ben** is a senior consultant at Lumanity, where he specialises in providing evidence on the comparative effectiveness of medicines to health care services. Ben has a PhD in comparative cognition which focused on replication and research methods in the study of animal cognition.

For any questions, please contact us at [themanymanys1@gmail.com](mailto:themanymanys1@gmail.com). We look forward to the conversation and seeing you there!
