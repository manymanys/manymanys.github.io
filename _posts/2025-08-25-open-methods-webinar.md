We are excited to launch registration for our first open webinar exploring the connection between open science and comparative cognition: Open Methods in Comparative Cognition Research.

This session will explore what it means to implement open methods in comparative cognition research. We will consider the challenges, practices, and caveats involved in applying open science principles to the field, with particular attention to developing species-fair designs and sustaining collaboration and transparency in the context of large-scale team science.

The webinar will feature presentations by Dr. Emma Tecwyn and Dr. Ben Farrar, followed by an interactive discussion with participants. It is free and open to all, whether or not you are part of the ManyManys network and regardless of career stage.

ðŸ“… When: September 12, 11:00 a.m. (ET) on Zoom

ðŸŽ¤ Presenters: Dr. Emma Tecwyn and Dr. Ben Farrar
