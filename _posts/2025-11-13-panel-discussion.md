Big Team Science (BTS) promises collaborative innovation and robust, transparent research—but how does it affect individual career trajectories? This panel explores the complex relationship between contributing to large-scale collaborative projects and advancing through academic contexts that vary in their commitment to open science values and their reliance on conventional performance metrics.

Join us as panelists across career stages discuss critical questions: How do trainees navigate the pace of collaborative projects while meeting individual program timelines and building specialized expertise? How do early-career researchers translate substantial BTS contributions into competitive job applications when evaluation committees may or may not value collaborative work? What is the interplay between building an independent research identity and contributing to large collaborative teams? And how do senior researchers approach trainee involvement in BTS projects in a shifting landscape?

We will address issues such as authorship, recognition, and resource allocation—acknowledging real challenges while also identifying opportunities that emerge when BTS projects are intentionally structured to support career development.

Whether you are considering joining a BTS project, already participating and wondering how to maximize its value, leading one, or evaluating candidates who have contributed to collaborative science, this panel offers essential perspectives on making Open and Big Team Science work for everyone involved.
