**Abstract:** Preregistration and Registered Reports are recent developments that aim to counteract systematic bias. The goal of preregistration is to allow others to transparently evaluate how severely a claim has been tested. In this talk I will reflect on whether preregistration achieves this goal. I will also reflect on criticisms of preregistration, points of improvement, and challenges for future metascientific research, such as how to deal with deviations from preregistrations. 

**Daniel Lakens** is a Full Professor in Metascience at the Human-Technology Interaction group at Eindhoven University of Technology. He works actively on improving research methods and statistical inferences, and has published on the importance of replication research, sequential analyses and equivalence testing, and frequentist statistics. He was involved in establishing dedicated grants for replication studies by the Dutch science funder NWO, and with Brian Nosek co-edited a special issue with the first Registered Reports in psychology in 2014. He teaches better research practices on Coursera, published a free open textbook on statistics, and received the Leamer-Rosenthal Prize for Open Social Science in 2017 for his course ‘Improving Your Statistical Inferences’ in which more than 70.000 learners have enrolled. In 2023 he won the Ammodo Science award for fundamental research in the Social Sciences, and he is currently funded by an NWO VICI project on the meaningful interpretation of effect sizes.

The presentation will be followed by an interactive discussion with participants. The webinar is free and open to all, regardless of ManyManys membership or career stage. We encourage you to join and share this invitation widely with colleagues and students who might be interested.
