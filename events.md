We are happy to announce our upcoming panel discussion:

**Navigating Career Development in Open and Big Team Science: Challenges and Opportunities**

**Date & time:** November 24, 10–11 a.m. (ET)

**Speakers:** Melanie Soderstrom, Erin Buchanan, Nicholas Coles, & Kyndal Irwin

Big Team Science (BTS) promises collaborative innovation and robust, transparent research—but how does it affect individual career trajectories? This panel explores the complex relationship between contributing to large-scale collaborative projects and advancing through academic contexts that vary in their commitment to open science values and their reliance on conventional performance metrics.

Join us as panelists across career stages discuss critical questions: How do trainees navigate the pace of collaborative projects while meeting individual program timelines and building specialized expertise? How do early-career researchers translate substantial BTS contributions into competitive job applications when evaluation committees may or may not value collaborative work? What is the interplay between building an independent research identity and contributing to large collaborative teams? And how do senior researchers approach trainee involvement in BTS projects in a shifting landscape?

We will address issues such as authorship, recognition, and resource allocation—acknowledging real challenges while also identifying opportunities that emerge when BTS projects are intentionally structured to support career development.

Whether you are considering joining a BTS project, already participating and wondering how to maximize its value, leading one, or evaluating candidates who have contributed to collaborative science, this panel offers essential perspectives on making Open and Big Team Science work for everyone involved.

# Webinar: Open Methods in Comparative Cognition Research
<img src="https://github.com/manymanys/manymanys.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/open_methods_webinar_flyer.png?raw=true" alt="Open Methods webinar flyer" style="max-width: 600px; height: auto;">

We are excited to launch registration for our first open webinar exploring the connection between open science and comparative cognition: Open Methods in Comparative Cognition Research.

This session will explore what it means to implement open methods in comparative cognition research. We will consider the challenges, practices, and caveats involved in applying open science principles to the field, with particular attention to developing species-fair designs and sustaining collaboration and transparency in the context of large-scale team science.

The webinar will feature presentations by Dr. Emma Tecwyn and Dr. Ben Farrar, followed by an interactive discussion with participants. It is free and open to all, whether or not you are part of the ManyManys network and regardless of career stage.

📅 When: September 12, 11:00 a.m. (ET) on Zoom

🎤 Presenters: Dr. Emma Tecwyn and Dr. Ben Farrar

ManyManys is a Big Team Science network dedicated to investigating cognition and behavior across species. We are currently working towards finalizing the design of our first large-scale empirical study on reversal learning, and we want to ensure that all interested researchers have the opportunity to participate.
Our initial survey showed that many potential contributors are unfamiliar with the reversal learning paradigm. To address this, we are hosting a series of open webinars exploring how reversal learning can be implemented with different taxa. These sessions are open to both current MM members and researchers interested in joining this collaborative effort. If your lab collects behavioral data with any species, we encourage you to attend and learn how you can be part of this unprecedented comparative cognition study.

📅 Webinar schedule:

〰️ Reversal Learning with Humans and Non-Human Primates – March 13, 11:00 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. (ET)

〰️ Reversal Learning with Ungulates, Rodents, Fishes, and Marine Invertebrates – March 14, 10:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m. (ET)

〰️ Reversal Learning with Birds, Reptiles, and Amphibians – March 25, 10:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m. (ET)

We would greatly appreciate it if you could share this invitation with colleagues who might be interested.

We look forward to seeing many of you there!




# Open Webinar: "Reversal Learning Across Taxa: Exploring Applications and Standardizing Procedures for Comparative Cognition Research"
