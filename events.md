We are excited to launch registration for our first open webinar exploring the connection between open science and comparative cognition: Open Methods in Comparative Cognition Research.

This session will explore what it means to implement open methods in comparative cognition research. We will consider the challenges, practices, and caveats involved in applying open science principles to the field, with particular attention to developing species-fair designs and sustaining collaboration and transparency in the context of large-scale team science.

The webinar will feature presentations by Dr. Emma Tecwyn and Dr. Ben Farrar, followed by an interactive discussion with participants. It is free and open to all, whether or not you are part of the ManyManys network and regardless of career stage.

📅 When: September 12, 11:00 a.m. (ET) on Zoom

🎤 Presenters: Dr. Emma Tecwyn and Dr. Ben Farrar

ManyManys is a Big Team Science network dedicated to investigating cognition and behavior across species. We are currently working towards finalizing the design of our first large-scale empirical study on reversal learning, and we want to ensure that all interested researchers have the opportunity to participate.
Our initial survey showed that many potential contributors are unfamiliar with the reversal learning paradigm. To address this, we are hosting a series of open webinars exploring how reversal learning can be implemented with different taxa. These sessions are open to both current MM members and researchers interested in joining this collaborative effort. If your lab collects behavioral data with any species, we encourage you to attend and learn how you can be part of this unprecedented comparative cognition study.

📅 Webinar schedule:

〰️ Reversal Learning with Humans and Non-Human Primates – March 13, 11:00 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. (ET)

〰️ Reversal Learning with Ungulates, Rodents, Fishes, and Marine Invertebrates – March 14, 10:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m. (ET)

〰️ Reversal Learning with Birds, Reptiles, and Amphibians – March 25, 10:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m. (ET)

We would greatly appreciate it if you could share this invitation with colleagues who might be interested.

We look forward to seeing many of you there!




# Open Webinar: "Reversal Learning Across Taxa: Exploring Applications and Standardizing Procedures for Comparative Cognition Research"
![Webinar flyer](/assets/img/jul2023_webinar_rl.png)
The ManyManys 1 project is thrilled to invite you to our upcoming open webinar, “Reversal Learning Across Taxa: Exploring Applications and Standardizing Procedures for Comparative Cognition Research,” which will take place on **September 1, 2023, at 10–12 AM (EST) / 9–11 AM (CST) / 7–9 AM (PST) / 3–5 PM (BST) / 4–6 PM (CEST)**. This event is an excellent opportunity to delve deeper into our network and discover opportunities for joining our team. We will explore various aspects of reversal learning, its applications, and its potential for shaping the future of comparative cognition research. We will also hold a discussion around the methodological details of the reversal learning task currently under development for ManyManys 1.

**Event schedule:**

〰️ 10:00–10:45 (EST). Presentation: “Reversal Learning Across Taxa: Exploring Applications and Standardizing Procedures for Comparative Cognition Research” by Dr. Nicolás Alessandroni (Concordia University, Canada).

〰️ 10:45–12:00 (EST). Open discussion: “Developing a Standardized Reversal Learning Task for ManyManys 1”, led by Dr. Laurent Prétôt (Pittsburg State University, USA).
